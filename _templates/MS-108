Device uses [TYWE2S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe2s) with the backside of the module with labelled pins exposed and easily accessible.
Flashing is a bit tricky. RX and TX are not easily accessible.
With an appropriate soldering tool you have to unsolder the green electrolytic capacitor to be able to solder wires to RX and TX.
After flashing, solder the electrolytic capacitor back on. Attention: the electrolytic capacitor is polarized, it must be soldered as it was before on the board.
